# Barbershop "Borodinsky" - README

## Overview  
This website was one of my first projects where I applied all the knowledge gained from the HTML Academy course. It represents the "Borodinsky" barbershop, created to showcase services, news, contact information, and booking functionality. The site includes sections highlighting the barbershop’s advantages, news updates, a photo gallery, contact details, and a booking form. It also features modal windows for user login and an interactive map.
